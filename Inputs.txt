Direction inputs you can use and how to write them down :

forward 							f
back								b
down								d
down + forward						d/f
down + back							d/b	
up + forward						u/f
down + back							d/b
forward and hold					F
up forward and hold					U/F
down forward and hold				D/F
down back and hold					D/B
neutral								n
quarter circle forward				qcf or QCF
quarter circle back					qcb or QCB
crouch dash							cd or CD
while standing						ws or WS

button inputs are

1
2
3
4
1+2
3+4
1+3
2+4
1+4
2+3
1+2+3
1+2+4
1+2+3+4

Semantics :

For an EWGF for example, you could use
f n d d/f 2
or f n d d/f+2
or cd 2
or CD+2

For now you can only have one direction and as many buttons in a "+ block", ie you can have f+1+2+3, 
but not d+f+1+2, as you never need to input 2 directions at the same time (other than d/f and the likes, which have shortcuts)

Each input must be separated by a space or a comma ( "," ) for example fF+1 won't work, you need to put it as f F+1 or f,F+1. 


If you want to separate moves inside a combo, you can use ";" to get the green arrow used in the ingame sample combos as a separator.
This ";" must come after a space too, it's treated just as another input.

Wrong inputs : 

any input the code can't read SHOULD come out as a red "?", but it sometimes comes out as a neutral symbol, not too sure why ... 
I think it's a remnant of some early code. :)
